# Prework
*Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp*

## Introduction
This repository contains the prework for the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. 


## Getting Started

Before starting with the challenges, read the Prework lessons in LMS (Ironhack's student platform) and make sure you've installed all the required software. To complete the Prework exercises, you will mainly need Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook. 

To get started, fork this repository and clone it to your local file system. Navigate to the repository directory using the command line and then, start Jupyter Notebook.

In the repository, you will find two directories: Python and Statistics. 

#### Python
To complete the Python exercises, navigate to the Python directory. This directory includes a bunch of folders, each with a problem for you to solve. Refer to the `README.md` file for further instructions.

#### Statistics
To complete the statistics exercises, navigate to the Statistics directory, where you will find instructions about how to complete the statistics challenges in the `README.md` file found there.

## Deliverables
The files you need to submit are:
- The `.ipynb` files of each Python challenge including the solutions.
- Screenshots of all the challenges in the `Data Science Math Skills` course in Coursera. 

## Summary
Read the instructions of the prework challenges carefully. Remember that if you have any doubt, you can reach out to Ironhack's instructional support team.
